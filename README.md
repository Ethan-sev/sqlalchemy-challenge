# sqlalchemy-challenge

Climate.ipynb was is just some climate data on different areas in hawaii. 
Similarly the Flask section of this challenege was focused on getting data from sqlite and showing it in a html. 
I had to use a couple of AI sources as well as BCS learning for this challenge as some of the syntax can be fairly difficult to understand and the error messages were sometimes unclear which required a lot of trial and error.
